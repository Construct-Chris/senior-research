# Investigating the Power Efficiency of OpenFaaS

Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a cloud computing service that runs code in response to specific requests or events. Both Docker and OpenFaaS can be used to create FaaS. As demand for cloud services increases, so does the amount of energy data centers consume.

## Objective

Determine when OpenFaaS produces more power efficient functions than Docker.

### Significance

Data centers can use this research to select the optimal platform for each function to improve power efficiency.
